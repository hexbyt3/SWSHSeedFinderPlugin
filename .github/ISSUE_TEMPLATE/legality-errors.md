**Describe the problem**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is. This is not to ask why impossible sets cannot be legalized. That should be obvious.
If you encounter a legal pokemon that timed out or didn't legalize properly, upload the `error_log.txt` file present in the same directory as PKHeX

**To Reproduce**
Please provide the exact set that failed to legalize or a PKM file that failed legalization or adequate information so that we may quickly replicate the parsing behavior on our end. Also specify if any trainerdata was being used.

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots of Plugin Settings help explain your problem.
